Dear Stream Protocol and Medusa Community and Developers,

I am excited to present an innovative proposal that aims to transform the way we handle web3 payments within the Stream Protocol and Medusajs ecosystems. We are proposing the creation of a comprehensive payment system and merchant application based on the cutting-edge blockchain technology of Solana and Cicle. This **Stream**Payments (Payment Provider), also known as Stream**Pay**, aims to benefit consumers, Medusajs users, merchants, and the entire community.

Notice! This is an early version.

**The Vision:**
Stream Protocol’s goal is to develop a user-friendly payment system that supports both cryptocurrencies and local and online payments, all based on Solana's robust blockchain technology. By doing so, we can offer seamless, secure, and cost-effective transactions for all users and merchants within the Medusa e-Commerce ecosystem.

**The Benefits:**

| Benefit                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhanced User Experience | Users will enjoy quick, reliable, and secure payment processing, making transactions smoother than ever before.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Financial Inclusion     | By supporting cryptocurrencies, Stream Token (STRM), and stablecoins like USDC and EURC, we enable users to transact with their preferred digital assets.                                                                                                                                          |
| Empowering Merchants    | **Stream**Payments (protocol) allows merchants to set their own transfer fees, resulting in more flexibility and potential for significant income.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Cost-Effectiveness      | Eliminating the need for expensive third-party services such as Stripe and PayPal will result in cost savings for merchants, driving adoption and usage.                                                                                                                                        |
| Community Participation | As a core pillar of our project, the Medusa community will actively participate in the development of this payment system, ensuring that it aligns with their needs and preferences.                                                                                                            |

**Token Incentives:**
To further strengthen the community's engagement and commitment, developers, the Stream**Pay** app, Medusa Store users, and contributors will receive tokens as a share in the ecosystem. This incentive program will foster a collaborative environment and encourage active participation in shaping the future of Medusa's payment system.

**StreamPay:**
We propose the name "Stream**Pay**" for the payment system, reflecting its efficient and streamlined nature. Through **Stream**Payments (Payment Provider) and Stream**Pay**, we envision the Medusa e-Commerce ecosystem expanding into the world of blockchain technology, positioning itself as an industry leader.

**Technical Aspects:**
The foundation of Stream**Pay** will be Solana's blockchain, known for its incredible speed and low fees. With an estimated Solana transfer fee of just 0.00025 USD + 5% **Stream**Payments protocol (2%) and merchant (3%) fees, merchants can stand to benefit significantly, especially if they set a small percentage fee for the customers. This approach will be a much cheaper alternative compared to Stripe and PayPal equivalents.

**Looking Forward:**
We believe that this collaborative effort will be a game-changer for Medusa and its community. With your support and active involvement, we can create a revolutionary payment system that will have far-reaching positive impacts on the Medusa ecosystem.
